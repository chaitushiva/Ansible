llow Root Logins on All Nodes

Log into each of your nodes as the root user, one at a time, and perform the following steps:

1. Change the password of the root account to “Anything you like”. Ignore any cautions about the password
strength.

# passwd

I have already done this so will not do it.

2. Copy the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to sshd_config.bak, and then edit the file:

# cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak
# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

3. In the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, comment or uncomment lines to match what is below:

PermitRootLogin yes (uncomment line, set to “yes”)
PasswordAuthentication yes (uncomment line, set to “yes”)

If the file also contains either of these lines, delete them or comment them out:

PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no

4. Save the file, and run this command:

# sshd –t

If no output is returned, proceed. If there are any errors, correct them before continuing.

5. Restart the sshd service:
# service sshd restart
